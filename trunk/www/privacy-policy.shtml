<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>As academics, most of the software we develop at The James Hutton Institute is made available for
free, to anyone, anywhere in the world. This ultimately means we have an
interest in knowing where it ends up being used.</p>

<p>To help us acheive that, Tablet contains code that logs an entry on our
server whenever it is run. This contains:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your IP address, so we know (roughly) where in the world you are. We currently
map this to a location using <a href="http://www.infosniper.net">
http://www.infosniper.net</a> which allows us to determine which city and/or country
an IP address request comes from.</li><p></p>
<li>Your operating system, as determined by Java. This will be a simple string
along the lines of "Windows XP" or "Mac OS X".</li><p></p>
<li>The version of Tablet you are using.</li>
</ul>

<p>No other information is collected, and what we do collect is used solely for the
purpose of knowing where in the world our software is used.</p>
