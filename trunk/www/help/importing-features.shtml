<h2>Importing Features</h2>

<p>Select <b>Import Features</b> from the <a href="ribbon.shtml">Ribbon Bar</a>
to import a <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml">GFF3 formatted</a>
file containing additional feature information that
you want to associated with an assembly.

<p>Once a feature file has been loaded, the <b>Features Browser</b> tab will become
active whenever a contig is selected that contains features.</p>

<p>Clicking on a feature will automatically move the view to the column where
the feature starts. It will also be highlighted for a few seconds. (If you wish to
outline the column more permanently, right-click it and select <b>Outline > Outline
Column</b> from the popup menu.)</p>

<p>Tablet can treat feature positions as either padded or unpadded depending on
whether the <b>Feature values are padded</b> checkbox is selected or not. This
setting determines where in the consensus sequence a feature will start and end,
with padded values counting pad (*) characters and unpadded  values ignoring them.
</p>


<h3>Visualizing features</h3>

<p>Once features have been imported, Tablet will automatically select and display
tracks for the first three feature types found.</p>

<p><a href="images/features-track.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/features-track2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<p>The active tracks can be enabled, disabled, or reordered using the <b>Select
Tracks</b> option located within the Features tab.</p>

<p>Each unique type of feature (eg, SNP, INDEL, etc) as defined in the GFF file
will be rendered using a distinct colour.</p>

<p>Please note that this functionality is still experimental, and is subject to
change. Tablet currently makes no attempt to link features, or to separate
features with overlapping positions onto new tracks.</p>
