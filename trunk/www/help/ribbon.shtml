		Changes the display so that reads are organised into a <i>stacked</i> layout,
		where every read is positioned on its own row.</li>
		<li><b>Packed (Paired End)</b><br>

		same row, it places multiple pairs on the same row.</li>
		<li><b>Stacked (Paired End)</b><br>

		row, it places pairs of reads on their own row.</li>
