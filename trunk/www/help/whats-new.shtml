that have been made to Tablet in recent versions. For full details on all the
changes between versions, please see the <a href="http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/svn.txt">
subversion change log</a>.</p>

<h3>New in 1.10.10.06</h3>

<ul>
<li>BUG: OS X only. Temporary fix for loading problems on OS X 10.5.8 due to issues with the SQLite driver. Performance will be lower than normal. 10.6.x seems unaffected.</li>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added the ability to search for sequence strings within the consensus / reference.</li>

<li>NEW: Mouse-over on any paired-end read will also show information on its mate.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a new colour scheme - Read Type - that paints reads based on type: unpaired, 1st in pair, 2nd in pair, or orphaned.</li>
<li>NEW: Added right-click mouse options to jump to a read's mate (within same BAM window, different window, or different contig).</li>
<li>NEW: Right-clicking on two paired reads' link lines gives options to jump to the reads at either end.</li>
<li>NEW: BAM files can now be loaded without the need to specify a reference file.</li>
<li>NEW: The Contigs Table now contains custom rendering based on what data is available (important for BAM).</li>
<li>NEW: GFF features can now be rendered alongside the alignment.</li>
<li>NEW: GFF features are rendered in a distinct colour per type.</li>

<li>NEW: Added a summary message at the end of importing features that gives information on the numbers imported.</li>
<li>NEW: Added installer file type association for ace, afg, sam, and bam (for OS X only).</li>

<li>NEW: Added mouse drag navigation to all reference tracking visual elements (consensus, coverage, scale, etc).</li>
<li>NEW: Tablet now warns if the reference length expected by a BAM file differs from that of the actual reference imported by the user.</li>
<li>NEW: Moved the default location for saving prefs information from ~/.tablet.xml to ~/.scri-bioinf/tablet.xml (with old files being automatically moved over if found).</li>
<li>NEW: Updated the GFF reader to cope with files containing ##FASTA directives.</li>
<li>CHG: Pack style selection is now performed via a drop down menu rather than separate ribbon buttons.</li>
<li>CHG: Major changes to the way files are handled, detected and loaded.</li>
<li>CHG: Only one open/close operation is needed per file now to detect its type (rather than one open/close per possible type).</li>
