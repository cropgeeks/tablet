<p>This page describes the additions (NEW), changes (CHG) and bug fixes (BUG)
that have been made to Tablet in recent versions. For full details on all the
changes between versions, please see the <a href="http://bioinf.scri.ac.uk/tablet/svn.txt">

<h3>New in 1.10.03.04</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added support for indexed BAM assemblies.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a new navigation bar for moving the viewing window around within a larger BAM assembly.</li>
<li>NEW: Implemented background (multicore) thread support for calculating auxiliary display data, meaning large contigs can now be viewed instantly.</li>
<li>NEW: Various implementation changes mean less memory is now used for large contigs.</li>
<li>NEW: The Open Assembly dialog is now significantly quicker at detecting the assembly type.</li>
<li>NEW: The page left/right controls now hide when the edges of the display are reached.</li>
<li>NEW: Added options to the Preferences Dialog to enable/disable disk caching (where supported).</li>
<li>NEW: Loading a very large number of features is now much faster.</li>
<li>NEW: The bp coordinates (data set/BAM window and current view) are now shown on the overview images.</li>
<li>CHG: Updated the mismatch code to ignore regions of reads that extend beyond the left or right ends of the consensus.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with files being ignored when passed to Tablet on the command line.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a bug which caused Tablet to not exit correctly when a filter had been applied in the Contigs Table.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed multiple issues with AFG parsing related to clr and gap tags.</li>
<li>BUG: The unpadded read length was no longer being shown in the popup information box.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 1.10.02.08</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added (experimental) support for BAM, using in-memory only reading for now, NOT indexed support.</li>
<li>NEW: Support for most CIGAR operations, with the positions of Insertions being tagged as features for now.</li>
<li>NEW: Displayed consensus sequences now use 8 bytes per base less memory.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a (prefs-file only) option to disable all disk caching for maximum performance at the expense of memory.</li>
<li>NEW: The Contigs Table now lists read vs consensus mismatch percentage information.</li>
<li>CHG: Some miscellaneous changes to cache support to speed up read retrieval.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a memory-leak problem with display-time objects not being removed after closing a contig.</li>
<li>BUG: Tablet now only deletes the cache files it creates, rather than every file in its cache directory.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 1.10.01.28</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added a right-click "save a summary of read information (per contig)" option to the contigs table.</li>
<li>NEW: Tablet can now read from http streams (supported on the command line and the Open Assembly dialog).</li>
<li>NEW: Tablet can now read from compressed gzip data streams (http or file).</li>
<li>NEW: Features outside the scope of the current contig are now highlighted in red in the Features Table.</li>
<li>NEW: Features with a Name= tag in a GFF3 file will now show this name in the Features Table.</li>
<li>NEW: Added an option to toggle on or off the use of regular expressions in searches.</li>
<li>CHG: The Importing Assembly dialog now shows its progress in MB/s too.</li>
<li>CHG: Removed support for consensus tags in ACE files. GFF3 formatted files are now the only way to import features.</li>
<li>BUG: Loading the same features file twice will no longer result in duplicate entries.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 1.09.12.14</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added an option to export coverage summary information to a file on disk.</li>
<li>NEW: Added an explicit cancel option to the progress dialogs (even though closing the dialog did cancel them anyway).</li>
<li>NEW: Added a right-click "copy-to-clipboard" option for the contigs table data.</li>
<li>CHG: The Application Menu now contains an "Export" sub menu with multiple items, including the old Export Image option.</li>
<li>CHG: Tidied up and enhanced Table's file-handling error messages, to ensure file and line number is always given.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with the current contig getting reselected when sorting the contigs table.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed an issue with the "Are you sure..." warning messages sometimes appearing multiple times.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed several rendering issues with the new stack-based names overlay.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with ACE file parsing when badly formatted consensus tags are present.</li>
</ul>
