<h2>BAM Data Visualization</h2>

<p>Tablet displays data on a per-contig basis. Select a contig using the
<a href="contigs-browser.shtml">Contigs Browser</a> to mark it for visualization.</p>

<p>Tablet supports BAM indexed query for visualizing large alignments. Indexed
	query makes it possible to support visualization of alignments in the hundreds
	of gigabytes of data on disk. In this view, Tablet displays subsets of the
	data at a time; while still providing the ability to move easily through -
	and jump to any point within - the dataset.</p>

<p>The visualization of indexed BAM data is subtly different from the visualization
	of other assembly formats. While most of the display remains as described in
	<a href="data-visualization.shtml">Data Visualization</a>, there are a few extra
	display components to aid the visualization - and navigation - of indexed BAM data.</p>

<h3>The BAM bar</h3>

<p>The BAM bar shows the position of the current data window in the overall BAM
	file. It also displays the size of the current data window relative to the
	size of the entire data set.</p>

<p><a href="images/bambar.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/bambar2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<p>The BAM bar always displays the locations of the current (in white)
	and previous ("ghost") data windows. The white bar (representing the current
	data window) can be grabbed and moved to select another window of data of
	that size in the BAM file. Alternatively the BAM bar can be clicked on and
	white bar will move to this new location. While the white bar is being
	dragged, the reads canvas displays information to aid selection of a new
	data window. This includes the starting and ending bases of the new data
	window, the data window size and the data window size as a percentage of the
	entire data set.</p>

<p><a href="images/bamreadscanvas.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/bamreadscanvas2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<p>The BAM bar also has a right click context menu. This menu contains an option
	for returning to the previous location in the data set and an option for
	adjusting the BAM window size using the <a href="gui.dialog.prefs.PreferencesDialog.shtml">
	Tablet Options</a> dialog.</p>


<h3>Changes to the reads canvas</h3>

<p>The reads canvas remains largely unchanged from that described in
	<a href="data-visualization.shtml">Data Visualization</a>. The main difference
	is that the area which can be scrolled through is defined by the BAM window
	size instead of the size of the entire data set. Paging through the data set
	is also altered. Within a BAM window, paging operates as normal, moving the
	display forwards or back by the number of bases which fit in the display. At
	the edge of a BAM window, the paging arrows change behaviour to loading the
	next BAM window size of data from the BAM file. When a paging arrow is going
	to do this its colour changes to green.</p>

<p>An addition to the tooltip which appears when the mouse is over to read is the
	inclusion of CIGAR information for that read. BAM uses an extended CIGAR
	format to encode information about reads. In BAM the reads are built up from
	the read sequence and the information in the CIGAR to display the final read.</p>

<h3>Overviews</h3>

<p>When viewing BAM alignments, data overviews are not of the whole data set as
	they are when viewing other assembly files. They are overviews of the data
	in the current BAM data window. Whole data set overviews are not available for
	BAM alignments. In all other regards the information on overviews in the
	<a href="overviews.shtml">overviews</a> section relates to BAM data overviews
	as well.</p>

<h3>Contigs panel</h3>

<p>The contigs panel displays the name, length, number of reads, number of
	features and the percentage mismatch for each contig. When viewing BAM
	alignments the percentage mismatch cannot be displayed until the data
	for a contig is loaded, and even then, it will only be the mismatch
	value for that particular BAM window (which may be smaller than the 
	actual size of the contig).</p>

<h3>Coverage printer</h3>

<p>The coverage printer feautre is not currently available while viewing
	BAM files. The coverage printer prints out the coverage over each reference
	base. When viewing BAM files the whole data set is not available, as such
	the coverage printer is disabled when viewing BAM files.</p>
