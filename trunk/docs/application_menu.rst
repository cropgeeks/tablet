Export Coverage Summary
-----------------------

Allows you to export a summary of the coverage across all contigs of the currently loaded assembly. This exports a list of contigs with the coverage value for each base of the consensus.

- Tablet Options
	Displays the :doc:`tablet_options` dialog that allows you to adjust various Tablet settings.
