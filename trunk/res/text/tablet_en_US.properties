gui.ribbon.RibbonController.colors = Color Schemes

gui.ribbon.BandLayout.bColorScheme = Read Colors
gui.ribbon.BandLayout.bColorScheme.tooltip = Read Coloring
gui.ribbon.BandLayout.bColorScheme.richtip = Provides shortcuts for selecting \
	one of the read color schemes (for more details see the Color Schemes \
	tab).

gui.ribbon.BandColors.title = Read Coloring
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bStandard.tooltip = Nucleotide Color Scheme
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bStandard.richtip = Display the data using an \
	enhanced graphical color scheme that renders each nucleotide in a unique \
	color. Variant bases are drawn in a lighter shade with the base value \
	drawn in red.
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bDirection = Direction
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bDirection.tooltip = Directional Color Scheme
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bDirection.richtip = Display the data using a two \
	color model with the reads being colored according to their \
	orientation (forward/uncomplemented or reverse/complemented). Variant \
	bases are drawn in a lighter shade with the base value drawn in red.
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bReadType.tooltip = Read Type Color Scheme
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bReadType.richtip = Display the data using a three \
	color model with the reads being colored according to their type: \
	unpaired, 1st in pair, or 2nd in pair. Variant \
	bases are drawn in a lighter shade with the base value drawn in red. This \
	scheme is obviously only suitable for paired-end data sets.
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bText.tooltip = Classic Color Scheme
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bPacked.richtip = Organize the reads so that they \
	use as little vertical space as possible.
gui.ribbon.BandColors.bStacked.richtip = Organize the reads so that every \
	read is on a separate line.

gui.ribbon.BandOverlays.bEnableText.richtip=Enable displaying the textual form \
	of the nucleotide or protein data for each base. This setting has no \
	effect if using the Classic color scheme.
gui.ribbon.BandOverlays.bShadowingCenter.tooltip=Center-locked Read Shadowing
gui.ribbon.BandOverlays.bShadowingCenter.richtip=Enables read shadowing, with \
	the intersection line locked to the center region of the display.
gui.ribbon.BandOverlays.bShadowingCenter=RS Center

gui.ReadsGroupsPanel.colourChooser = Select read group color
gui.ReadGroupsPanelNB.readGroupLabel = Read group colors: {0}
gui.ReadGroupsPanelNB.colorAll=Color All
gui.ReadGroupsPanelNB.colorNone=Color None
gui.ReadsGroupsPanel.confirmReset=This will reset all colors and clear any \
	modifications you may have made to them.
gui.ReadsGroupTableModel.col2=Color
