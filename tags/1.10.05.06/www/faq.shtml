<h2>Tablet - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><b>Tablet only seems to be using up to 1GB of memory even though I have much
more than that installed on my PC.</b></p>
<p>Due to the way the Java runtime works, we have developed Tablet to run with a
maximum memory allocation of 1GB. This is decribed in more
detail in the <a href="help/memory.shtml">Allocating Memory</a> help topic,
along with instructions on how to adjust (higher or lower) the amount of memory
Tablet will use.</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>Maq assemblies do not appear to be loading. Which Maq files does Tablet require?</b></p>
<p>The Maq files that Tablet expects are the text file which can be generated from the .map
file and the fastq file which can be generated from the .cns maq file (see the
<a href="http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-manpage.shtml#3">Maq Reference Manual</a> for
more details).</p>
<p>To produce the text file from the .map file, you should execute the mapview command.
The format of the command should resemble <i>maq mapview input.map > output.txt</i>.</p>
<p>To produce the fastq file from the .cns file, you should execute the cns2fq command.
The format of the command should resemble <i>maq cns2fq input.cns > output.fastq</i>.</p>

<p>Also see our <a href="assembly-conversion.shtml">Assembly Conversion</a> guide
that covers coverting between several common assembly formats.</p>

<p><b>Why does every contig in my BAM assembly show the number of reads as "0"?</b></p>
<p>BAM assemblies are treated differently to other file formats in Tablet (to allow
instant access to portions of very large assemblies) and because of this it means
that Tablet is not able to provide summary information simply because Tablet hasn't
yet read all of the contig (and it most cases it never will). Once you view a contig,
information on the region you view will
become available, but please be aware that the numbers you see will change as
you move around the contig using the BAM controls. See
<a href="help/bam-data-visualization.shtml">BAM Data Visualization</a> for more information.</p>
