<h2>Importing Features</h2>

<p>Select <b>Import Features</b> from the <a href="ribbon.shtml">Ribbon Bar</a>
to import a <a href="http://www.sequenceontology.org/gff3.shtml">GFF3 formatted</a>
file containing additional feature information that
you want to associated with an assembly.

<p>Once a feature file has been loaded, the <b>Features Browser</b> tab will become
active whenever a contig is selected that contains features.</p>

<p>Clicking on a feature will automatically move the view to the column where
the feature starts. It will also be highlighted for a few seconds. (If you wish to
outline the column more permanently, right-click it and select <b>Outline > Outline
Column</b> from the popup menu.)</p>

<p>Tablet can treat feature positions as either padded or unpadded depending on
whether the <b>Feature values are padded</b> checkbox is selected or not. This
setting determines where in the consensus sequence a feature will start and end,
with padded values counting pad (*) characters and unpadded  values ignoring them.
