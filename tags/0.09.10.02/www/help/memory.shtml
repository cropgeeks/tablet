<h2>Allocating Memory</h2>

<p>Tablet is written in Java, and due to way the Java Runtime works the amount
of memory available for use by it must be defined before the application is
started. The default
value set at install time is one gigabyte (1024MB). If you need to allocate more
(or less) memory than this, the setting can be adjusted by following the relevant
instructions below.</p>

<p>Note though, that for any 32-bit system, the maximum amount of memory Tablet will
be able to use will be somewhere between 1.5GB and 2GB, regardless of the total
amount of memory installed. If you have data sets requiring more memory than
this then Tablet must be run under a 64-bit operating system.</p>


<h3>Windows & Linux</h3>

<p>Navigate to the directory in which Tablet is installed and locate the file
<b>tablet.vmoptions</b> and open it with a text editor. You will see a line
containing <b>-Xmx1024m</b> - replace '1024' with a memory allocation value (in
MB) of your choice.</p>

<h3>Mac OS X</h3>

<p>Navigate to Tablet's application icon (usually located in /Applications) and
CTRL/right-click the icon, selecting <b>Show Package Contents</b> from the
popup menu. Open /Contents/Info.plist and find the entry under <b>Root,
Java, VMOptions</b> (which defaults to <b>-Xmx1024m</b>), replacing '1024' with
a memory allocation value (in MB) of your choice.</p>
