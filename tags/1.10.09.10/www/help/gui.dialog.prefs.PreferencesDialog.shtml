<h2>Tablet Options Dialog</h2>

<p>The Preferences dialog can be used to modify various settings that affect the
way Tablet is used and is displayed.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<p>The <b>General</b> tab includes options which are specific to Tablet's general operation.</p>

<p><a href="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBGeneralPanel.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBGeneralPanel2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Interface Display Language</b><br>
	This setting determines what language Tablet will display its user interface in.</li>
	<li><b>Check for newer versions of Tablet</b><br>
	This setting determines how often Tablet will attempt to connect back to its
	download server to see if a newer version is available. The options available are
	Never, At application startup, Once a day, Once a week, and Once a month.</li>
	<li><b>Tablet requires a local directory for storing temporary files</b><br>
	Specifies the directory where Tablet will keep its disk cache (of the assembly
	data). The size of the cache depends on the size of the assembly, so it is
	advisable to pick a location with plenty of free space.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

<p>The <b>Visualization</b> tab allows you to customise elements of Tablet's visual display.</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Always allow at least this number of bases between reads</b><br>
    Forces Tablet to ensure that adjoining reads are always separated by at least
    the number of bases specified. As this affects how the data are packed, reopen
    the current contig to see any changes.</li>
	<li><b>Character to display for DNA pad/gap bases</b><br>
	Determines what character will be shown whenever a padded base is displayed.</li>
	<li><b>Character to display for Protein stop codons</b><br>
	Determines what character will be shown whenever DNA translates to a stop
	codon.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><b>Cache read data to disk</b><br>
  Selecting this option will ensure Tablet keeps the majority of read data for
  an assembly in a disk-based cache, rather than in memory. This marginally
  reduces performance, but has a significant saving on memory.</li>

<li><b>Cache padded/unpadded mapping data to disk</b><br>
  As above, selecting this option will ensure Tablet keeps the data for mapping between
  padded and unpadded locations in a disk-based cache, rather than in memory.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Importing</h3>

<p>The <b>Importing</b> tab allows you to modify how Tablet reads from data files.</p>

<p><a href="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBFormatsPanel.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBFormatsPanel2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Convert all DNA ambuiguity codes to 'N', rather than treating as unknowns</b><br>
    If selected, any nucleotides encoded using ambuiguity codes will be read as N rather
    than being treated as unknown (Tablet has no support for ambuiguity codes). This will
    affect how the protein translations are displayed.</li>

    <li><b>Trim poor quality tags using QA tags (ACE only)</b><br>
    Affecting the import of ACE files only, if selected, this option will cause Tablet to parse the QA tags found within
    ACE files. These tags cause reads to be trimmed for quality. The resultant
    read once loaded into Tablet may be shorter than if the option is left
    unselected and regions of low quality will no longer be displayed.</li>

    <li><b>Set BAM validation stringency to lenient rather than strict (BAM only)</b><br>
    Affecting the import of BAM files only, if selected, Tablet will ignore any errors often associated with malformed BAM
    assemblies and will attempt to display the file as if it was OK. Any errors that
    are found will be written to the output.log file in Tablet's install directory.
    See samtools/picard documentation for more details on strict/lenient parsing options.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>The <b>Warnings</b> tab allows you to switch on or off the various warnings that
Tablet can pop up from time to time. If an item is checked, Tablet will display
a relevant warning to you whenever its associated action occurs. Unchecking an
item means that Tablet will proceed with the action without warning you.</p>

<p><a href="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBWarningPanel.png">
<img class="capture" src="images/gui.dialog.prefs.NBWarningPanel2.png" alt="Tablet Screenshot"></a></p>

<ul>
	<li><b>Before closing an assembly if a file is already in memory</b><br>
	This warning occurs if you attempt to close an open assembly file. Some files
	can be large, and take time to load, so Tablet will check that you really <b>do</b>
	want to close the file before doing so.</li>
	<li><b>Before exiting Tablet if a file is still in memory</b><br>
	Similar to the above warning; this time the warning happens if you attempt
	to close Tablet while a file is still loaded.</li>
	<li><b>When attempting to load an assembly if no reference file was included</b><br>
	Not all assembly file formats include reference/consensus information in the
	primary file and it must be provided in a separate file. Tablet does not need
	this information, but can warn you if it is not included.</li>
	<li><b>When switching between features being treated as padded or unpadded</b><br>
	GFF3 feature files include position information that Tablet can treat as
	either a padded or unpadded position. Depending on the data, the difference
	between a padded or unpadded position can be significant, and you may wish
	Tablet to remind you of this.</li>
	<li><b>When a search has stopped after finding 500 results</b><br>
	Continuing to search after 500 matching hits have been found has a negative
	impact on memory consumption. Disable this option to stop Tablet from
	reminding you of this fact each time it searches.</li>
	<li><b>If sequence lengths specified in SAM/BAM files don't match those imported</b><br>
	Assemblies in SAM or BAM formats - although they do not store reference
	data - do store the name and length of the each reference sequence. Check this
	option to have Tablet warn whenever these specified lengths do not match
	the actual lengths of any reference sequences that you import.</li>
</ul>
