REBASE - The Restriction Enzyme Database

The Restriction Enzyme   data BASE
A collection of information about restriction enzymes and related proteins.
It contains published and unpublished references, recognition and cleavage
sites, isoschizomers, commercial availability, methylation sensitivity,
crystal, genome, and sequence data. DNA methyltransferases, homing
endonucleases, nicking enzymes, specificity subunits and control proteins
are also included. Putative DNA methyltransferases and restriction enzymes,
as predicted from analysis of genomic sequences, are also listed. REBASE is
updated daily and is constantly expanding.
