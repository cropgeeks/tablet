<p>The tablet.data package contains classes that are used for the storage of
assembly information. This package is mainly data classes with a few methods
in some classes that perform simple processing, such as sorting or searching for
data.</p>

<p>The overall data structure for Tablet starts with an assembly. An assembly
holds a list of contigs. Within each contig there is a consensus sequence and a
list of reads and a list of features. Both the classes for consensus and read
extend from Sequence which is an abstract base class for storing DNA data.</p>

<p>Note that "consensus space" within tablet is zero-indexed; that is the
consensus sequence's first base is at position zero. Reads are aligned against
this consensus and may have bases that extend to the left of this position (and
are therefore negative) or to the right of the consensus's final base.</p>
