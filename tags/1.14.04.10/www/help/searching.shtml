<h2>Searching for reads</h2>

<p>To search for reads by name, open the search panel and select <b>Search for reads
by name</b> from the first drop down list. The second drop down list determines
whether or not the search will look through all contigs for matches, or just the
currently loaded contig. Enter your search term in the combo box - this combo
box stores your previous search terms, so it is easy to select a previous search
- then click the search button. The table below the controls should fill in with
any results. Click on a result to have that read highlighted in the main display.</p>

<h3>Regular expressions</h3>
<p>When searching for reads by name it is possible to specify that the search
should use java regular expressions. When regular expressions aren't being used
the search will only find results that match the search term exactly. When regular
expressions are being used the search is attempting to match read names to the 
regular expression provided in the search combo box. As a simple example imagine
some reads are prefixed with an identifier. To find all the reads prefixed with
that identifier you would enter "prefix.*" (without the quotes) into the search
box and carry out the search. Further details on the regular expression syntax used
by Table can be found
<a href="http://download.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/regex/Pattern.html#sum">here.</a>
</p>

<h2>Searching for subsequences</h2>

<p>To search for subsequences of nucleotide data within either the reads, or the
consensus / reference sequence select either <b>Search for subsequences</b> or
<b>Search in consensus / reference</b> from the first drop down list. The second
drop down list determines whether or not the search will look through all contigs
for matches, or just the currently loaded contig. Enter your search term into the
combo box and click the search button. Once the search is complete the table below
will fill in with the results. Click on a result to jump to and highlight the
subsequence in the read or consensus / reference.</p>

<h3>Skipping pads</h3>
<p>When searching for subsequences the option to <b>Ignore pads when searching</b>
is available. This means that pads in the nucleotide sequences will be ignored
when trying to match against the search string. Ns are also skipped when this option
is selected, this means that for example the search term ACGT will match the following
sequences:</p>
<table>
 <tr>
  <td><b>A</b></td>
  <td><b>C</b></td>
  <td><b>G</b></td>
  <td><b>T</b></td>
 </tr>

  <td><b>A</b></td>
  <td><b>C</b></td>
  <td><b>*</b></td>
  <td><b>G</b></td>

  <td><b>G</b></td>
  <td><b>T</b></td>

  <td><b>C</b></td>
  <td><b>N</b></td>
  <td><b>G</b></td>
  <td><b>T</b></td>
 </tr>
