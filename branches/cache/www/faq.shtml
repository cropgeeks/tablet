<h2>Tablet - Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<p><b>Tablet only seems to be using up to 1GB of memory even though I have much
more than that installed on my PC.</b></p>
<p>Due to the way the Java runtime works, we have developed Tablet to run with a
maximum memory allocation of 1GB. This is decribed in more
detail in the <a href="help/memory.shtml">Allocating Memory</a> help topic,
along with instructions on how to adjust (higher or lower) the amount of memory
Tablet will use.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>On Linux, Tablet detects an update and downloads it, but does not execute
the update when I select that option.</b></p>
<p>This is a known issue with the Tablet installer running on Linux. Until a
solution is found, you may need to manually run the update after it has been downloaded
if it does not start automatically.</p>
<p>For example, if an update called <i>tablet_linux_x86_0_09_10_01.sh</i> is located
in your home directory, then change to that directory and run the following
from the command line:<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<i>sh tablet_linux_x86_0_09_10_01.sh</i>
</p>

<p><b>Maq assemblies do not appear to be loading. Which Maq files does Tablet require?</b></p>
<p>The Maq files that Tablet expects are the text file which can be generated from the .map
file and the fastq file which can be generated from the .cns maq file (see the
<a href="http://maq.sourceforge.net/maq-manpage.shtml#3">Maq Reference Manual</a> for
more details).</p>
<p>To produce the text file from the .map file, you should execute the mapview command.
The format of the command should resemble <i>maq mapview input.map > output.txt</i>.</p>
<p>To produce the fastq file from the .cns file, you should execute the cns2fq command.
The format of the command should resemble <i>maq cns2fq input.cns > output.fastq</i>.</p>
